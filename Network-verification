# Workflows for connection

    ## FIRST WORKFLOW: ITS IMPORTANT TO VERIFY HERE SYNCRONIZATION WITH COMM ON IP ADDRESSES
    ## SECOND WORKFLOW: IT MUST BE A COMPLETE CONCATENATION OF THE CONNECTIONS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE CONNECTIONS DETAILS
      
      # Exe first commands sequence for networking verification***EXECUTION MUST BE PRECISELY REVISED ACCORDING TO CONDITIONALS***
      - Cisco peripheral connections: execute set of commands based on conditionals IF-ELSE IF...***THIS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC STRUCTURES**
        run: print CONNECTIONS DONE once every PING has succesfully arrived

      # Exe second commands for IP verification***IP VERIFICATION WIL BE SUCCESFUL ONLY ON CORRECT NETWORKING PREMISES**PLEASE GET GOOD SYNTAX
      - IP NETWORK VERIFICATION: Execute a multi line script based on IF returning positive PINGS ELSE : FALSE
