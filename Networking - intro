# Workflows for connection

    ## FIRST WORKFLOW: Will define each peripheral condition connection by using the command prompt that the specialist will configure based on conditionals
    ## SECOND WORKFLOW: After the synchronization is done the ip addresses will be also connected each other ang giving correct PINGS
      
      # Exe first commands sequence for networking verification
      - Cisco peripheral connections: execute set of commands based on conditionals IF-ELSE IF...
        run: print CONNECTIONS DONE once every PING has succesfully arrived

      # Exe second commands for IP verification
      - IP NETWORK VERIFICATION: Execute a multi line script based on IF returning positive PINGS ELSE : FALSE
        run: sequence of commands for PING and ELSE
